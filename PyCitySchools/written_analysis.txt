Written Analysis:

In this report is a comprehensive analysis of a school district's information and testing scores. This report includes a summary of the average math and reading scores per school and the percentage of students passing per subject. A categorization of schools based on best and worst performances, and a comparison of spending per capita with test scores. 

Based on the data analysis, it is evident that the highest performing schools in the district are charter schools. In contrast, the lowest percentage of overall passing test grades can be observed in the district schools. Interestingly, schools with higher per-student spending also showed a lower percentage of overall passing students, whereas schools with a lower per-student budget had higher passing percentages. It should be noted that the charter schools, which had the highest performances, typically operate within the lower budget range, whereas district schools tend to have higher budgets. Based on this evidence, it's fair to conclude charter schools can operate at a high level without needing a bigger budget.
